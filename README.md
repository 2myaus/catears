# catears

Catears is a super simple network scanner written in C and powered by libpcap. It can capture locally connected device information over the air from ARP, MDNS, and DHCP packets.
I plan to rewrite this in the future in order to support many more packet types, provide more effective tracking, and add more options.
For now, this version can be built from source and used. The -h argument will list basic options.
